## GRAPHICS ANALYSIS

### Theme & palette (from About screenshot + site consistency)
- **Background:** Dark, near-black (#0f0f0f / similar).  
- **Text:** White and light gray for contrast.  
- **Accents:** Purple-to-blue gradient on primary CTAs (Contact Us, Let's Chat).  
- **Secondary accent:** Bright yellow/jagged line used in the “hands” graphic on About (contrast on grayscale hands).  
- **Overall:** Modern, clean, high-contrast; aligns with a “premium digital agency” look.

### Typography
- Sans-serif for headings and body.  
- Large, bold headings; smaller subheads and body.  
- Clear hierarchy: H1 → H2 → H3 → body.

### Layout
- **Header:** Logo (SOCIAL IT + “Digital Transformation Partner”), horizontal nav (Home, About Us, Services dropdown, Careers, Work, Blogs), Contact Us button (gradient).  
- **Services dropdown:** Dark panel, vertical list (Website Development, App Development, Social Media Marketing, etc.).  
- **About “numbers” section:** Four stat cards in a row; optional wavy/lighter gray line in background.  
- **About “hands” visual:** Two hands (knuckles up), grayscale, with a bright yellow jagged line across – suggests connection/creativity/digital transformation.

### Imagery & assets
- **Home:** Banner (homebanner.webp), service icons (Java, Flutter, React, etc.), leader photos (BoAt, PW, Zepto, CarDekho, Shaadi, Adobe), client photos, blog thumbnails, partner/integration logos.  
- **About:** “Let’s talk numbers” section, hands + yellow line graphic, leadership section.  
- **Career/Portfolio/Contact:** Card-based layouts, form fields, CTAs.

### Visual elements

- Yellow accent line as a strong focal point.  
- Logo strip for “Trusted & Awarded” and “integrations.”

## ANIMATION ANALYSIS

### Inferred / typical patterns (from structure and common practice)
- **Services dropdown:** Open/close (e.g. slide down + fade in) on hover/click.  
- **Stats (“Let’s talk numbers”):** Numbers with “+” suggest **count-up animations** (e.g. from 0 to 150+, 20K+, 8+, 20+) when the section enters viewport.  
- **CTA buttons (Contact Us, Let's Chat):** Hover states (e.g. brightness/scale/glow) consistent with “flashy” CTAs.  
- **Cards (services, testimonials, blog, jobs):** Possible **hover lift** or slight scale/shadow.  
- **Scroll:** Sections may use subtle fade-in or slide-up on scroll.  
- **Portfolio:** Filter switch + “Load More” often paired with reveal/fade or masonry-style layout updates.

### Not directly observable from fetch (but implied by design)
- Count-up on stats.  
- Sticky or shrink-on-scroll header.  
- Smooth scroll for anchor links.  
- Form validation/feedback on Contact/Career forms.

## CONTENT CORRECTIONS (from live site)

- **About – stats label:** Site uses “Years Expirence” → should be **“Years Experience”**.  
- **Nav:** “App Devlopment” → **“App Development”**.
